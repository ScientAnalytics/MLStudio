    Properties
    ----------
        params: dict. Training parameters
            (eg. batch size, number of epochs...).
        model: instance of `keras.models.Model`.
            Reference of the model being trained.

    The `logs` dictionary that callback methods
    take as argument will contain keys for quantities relevant to the current 
    batch or epoch. Currently, the `.fit()` methods of the Model class
    will include the following quantities in the `logs` that
    it passes to its callbacks:
        on_epoch_end: logs include `train_cost` and `train_score`, and
            optionally include `val_cost` (if validation is enabled ), 
            and `val_scpre` for the metric that is monitored.
        on_batch_begin: logs include `size`, the number of samples in the 
            current batch.
        on_batch_end: logs include `cost`, and optionally `score`
            (if a scoring metric is designated).
