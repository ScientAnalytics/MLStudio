Stable release
--------------

To install ML Studio, run this command in your terminal:

    $ pip install ml_studio

This is the preferred method to install ML Studio, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.
